ABOUT SPRITES IN MODE 3,4,5

You need to put them at starting address 0x06014000 and the starting sprite number will be 512.
You only have 512 sprites available in these modes.
Sprites 0-511 are not available due to the memory that is consumed by the bitmap plane.
BG Mode is 3~5 (Bitmap Mode)
OBJ character data RAM is halved to 16 KB, so character name numbers
0-511 are disabled and numbers 512 and greater are used.
